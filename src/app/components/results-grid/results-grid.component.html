        <div>These IP addresses returned a network error. It is possible that they are shelly devices with cross origin
            resource sharing turned off.</div>
        <div>'Enable CORS' will attempt to turn 'Allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing' on. If the device is a shelly this
            will allow the details to be loaded into the grid above.</div>
        <div>If no shellies are detected you may need to disable the chrome flag "Block insecure private network requests" (chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests). This is required as public sites are not typically able to access private IP addresses.</div>
